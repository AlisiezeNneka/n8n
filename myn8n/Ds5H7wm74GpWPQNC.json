It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n",

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n",

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n",

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n",

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"

It was a huge case back then,\n\n00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.961\nand everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her.\n\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.741\nBut no one was more desperate for answers than I was.\n\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320\nSarah and I'd been married for five years.\n\n00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.681\nI knew as soon as I met her\n\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.521\nthat I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.221\nShe had one of those smiles that just lit up a room.\n\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.680\nThat's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful,\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.541\nsuccessful woman had seemingly disappeared.\n\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560\nThey hadn't even recovered her body.\n\n00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.941\n15 years later, they still didn't have a shred of evidence.\n\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780\nNot a tire track or a fingerprint. Nothing.\n\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160\nThe police put out an appeal,\n\n00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.841\nbut no one came forward. Somehow\n\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:51.701\nnot a single person had seen her.\n\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.100\nIt was like she just vanished without a trace.\n\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.280\nI think about Sarah a lot.\n\n00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.481\nI can never quite bring myself\n\n00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.861\nto take down the photos of her from around the house.\n\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080\nSarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room.\n\n00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.261\nThere's one photo of her from our wedding day that I really love.\n\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400\nLooking at it is like looking straight at her.\n\n00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.801\nIt captured her perfectly.\n\n00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.381\nTwo days ago I found myself staring at it,\n\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920\nreally getting lost in the details.\n\n00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.581\nHer eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile.\n\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580\nThe small dimple on her left cheek.\n\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480\nI was looking at it so intently\n\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.701\nthat I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.\n\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.960\nIt was the landline phone.\n\n00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.621\nWhich is odd cause no one ever called me on the landline anymore.\n\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt was all mobiles nowadays.\n\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400\nWhen I looked at the caller ID,\n\n00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.981\nit was an unknown number. I shrugged and picked it up anyway.\n\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.820\nProbably just the bank calling to confirm something.\n\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.320\nThe call took a moment to connect,\n\n00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:39.921\nbut when it did,\n\n00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:45.021\nI heard a strange rustling SoundOn the other end of the line. Hello?\n\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.160\nI wasn't in the mood for any prank callers.\n\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.341\nIs anyone there?\n\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.060\nHello?\n\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.120\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.901\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.640\nThe voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice.\n\n00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:59.181\nIt was shaking and breathless.\n\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.660\nDaniel, it's me.\n\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.100\nIt's Sarah. Are you there?\n\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.200\nWhen I heard her name,\n\n00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.581\nit was like my heart stopped beating for a moment.\n\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660\nSarah? My Sarah.\n\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760\nBut that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago.\n\n00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.541\nWhoever this was was not my wife.\n\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.480\nI don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah.\n\n00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.081\nI hissed into the phone coldly.\n\n00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.001\nStop calling this number! I dealt with a lot of these calls.\n\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.841\nEspecially when Sarah first went missing.\n\n00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.121\nCon artists, fraudsters,\n\n00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.541\nanyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband.\n\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640\nI knew none of them were my wife.\n\n00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.361\nNo, Daniel, wait.\n\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.841\nYou have to listen to me. It is me.\n\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.561\nIt's Sarah. You have to believe me.\n\n00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.481\nShe was sounding shrill and desperate, now,\n\n00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.941\neven a little hysterical.\n\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380\nThe length that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.\n\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280\nWhy are you doing this? I asked angrily.\n\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.241\nIt's been 15 years since my wife disappeared.\n\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.441\nWhat do you want from me? For a moment,\n\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.061\nthe woman on the other end of the line didn't respond.\n\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940\nI was beginning to think that the call had disconnected\n\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.900\nwhen she finally spoke.\n\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.280\nDaniel, please,\n\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.201\nit's me. It's your wife, Sarah,\n\n00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.161\nthe woman begged. I'm telling the truth.\n\n00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt's me, she continued to plead,\n\n00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.921\nbut I'd had enough. I wasn't gonna listen anymore.\n\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.161\nDon't call this number again,\n\n00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.901\nI firmly told her, hanging up.\n\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200\nI thought that would do it.\n\n00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.641\nShe wouldn't be likely to call me again,\n\n00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.561\nand I assumed it was all over.\n\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:15.601\nThe next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system.\n\n00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.781\nHe was a good friend. I'd known him since college.\n\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600\nHe'd been there for me when Sarah disappeared,\n\n00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.201\ngetting me through it. We were both taking a break,\n\n00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.281\ncatching up on the important events in each other's lives,\n\n00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.381\nwhen my landline phone began to ring again.\n\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160\nSorry, I have to take this.\n\n00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.701\nIt might Be important, I said.\n\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.720\nI noticed the calls from an unknown number,\n\n00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.401\njust as it had been the day before.\n\n00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:35.881\nI didn't make a connection right away.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.921\nAfter all, it could have been the bank this time around.\n\n00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:42.181\nPicked up the phone, I heard the same rustling sound.\n\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200\nIt was unsettling in a strange way.\n\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.761\nAlmost felt like I'd heard it before.\n\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:48.141\nI couldn't put my finger on it. Hello?\n\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400\nI told you not to call this number.\n\n00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.361\nDaniel? Oh, Daniel,\n\n00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:55.081\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.001\nIt's me, Sarah,\n\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.701\nare you there? It was undoubtedly the same woman.\n\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040\nI don't have time for this.\n\n00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.361\nI know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me.\n\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:03.241\nWho was that? He asked me.\n\n00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.281\nI heard you saying Sarah's name.\n\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:05.461\nIs everything okay?\n\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.320\nIt was just a prank caller trying to pretend to be Sarah,\n\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.441\nI told him, rolling my eyes.\n\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.841\nI thought that I left it all behind.\n\n00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:11.961\nI even changed my phone number.\n\n00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.981\nI don't know how this woman got hold of my new one.\n\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800\nPretending to be Sarah, a friend echoed.\n\n00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.041\nThat's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it?\n\n00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.781\nLike the police? No,\n\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.120\nthere's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama.\n\n00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.141\nThey probably want money or something like that.\n\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.880\nI didn't want to continue talking about it,\n\n00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.501\nbringing up harmful reminders of the past.\n\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840\nI woke up the next day\n\n00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.501\nnot expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number.\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.560\nI made it very clear. That I wouldn't be participating in her charade.\n\n00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.401\nHowever, I was quickly proven wrong.\n\n00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:41.761\nAs soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.681\nthe phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring,\n\n00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.041\nbut I had a better idea.\n\n00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.461\nI was gonna issue a much stronger warning to the caller.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840\nOr just listen. Just. Yeah,\n\n00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.641\nyeah, yeah.\n\n00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.681\nOr just listen. Yeah,\n\n00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:52.881\nI know, yeah.\n\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281\nImagine being, like,\n\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.881\nkidnapped or something, calling.\n\n00:04:55.882 --> 00:04:57.201\nYour husband's been like, fuck off.\n\n00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.541\nYeah, he's never fucking seen me.\n\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340\nCome rescue me.\n\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.040\nPicked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.861\nI couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine.\n\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.700\nFinally, the call connected.\n\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt was the same as the other times.\n\n00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.761\nThe same pathetic monologue.\n\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.161\nDaniel? Daniel,\n\n00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:15.481\nthank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.881\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.721\nAre you there? If you don't stop calling this number,\n\n00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.361\nI have no choice but to involve the police.\n\n00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.241\nThis is harassment. If you want my money,\n\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.741\ntry calling someone else.\n\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.800\nBefore I could give the woman on the other line a chance to answer,\n\n00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.401\nI hung up the call. Hopefully,\n\n00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.441\nthis would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me.\n\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:34.761\nI could see right through her elaborate scam.\n\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.361\nI was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.\n\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.241\nI was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud,\n\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.561\npersistent ringing sound the next morning,\n\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.801\nI didn't even think to connect it to The unknown number calls first\n\n00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:47.521\nassumed it was my alarm waking me up.\n\n00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.521\nBut when I turned to look,\n\n00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.441\nI saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet.\n\n00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:53.881\nThat was when I reached the conclusion it was the landline phone again.\n\n00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.001\nI rushed down the stairs,\n\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.781\nwanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action.\n\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.420\nI got down there in time. When I picked up the phone,\n\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.660\nholding it to my ear, I heard the creepy rustling sound.\n\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.500\nIt made my heart beat faster.\n\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nDaniel?\n\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.220\nDaniel, thank goodness I finally reached you.\n\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.640\nDaniel, it's me, Sarah.\n\n00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.041\nAre you there? I gave you a warning.\n\n00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.241\nI said that if you called again,\n\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.761\nI take legal action. You've gone too far now.\n\n00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:18.121\nI have to do something about this.\n\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.941\nI waited for the woman to respond.\n\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.160\nDaniel,\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.760\nit's me. I'm not lying to you.\n\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.561\nI'd never lie to you. Daniel,\n\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:25.321\nit's me. Sarah,\n\n00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.941\nyour wife. It's me.\n\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.360\nYou're not Sarah. I told her bitterly.\n\n00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.541\nI know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye.\n\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.300\nI know that woman wasn't Sarah.\n\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.260\nI know for a fact she wasn't.\n\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.620\nI know it because on January the 7th, he killed\n\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880\nSarah Collins. Beloved member of the community was killed.\n\n00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.661\nAnd I was the one who killed her.\n\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.240\nSarah. Okay.\n\n00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.921\nI did not see that one coming.\n\n00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.301\nYeah, Sarah was shook ass.\n\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120\nShook ass. I can't lie.\n\n00:06:58.121 --> 00:06:59.301\nI did not see that coming.\n\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.000\nFucking hell. Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman.\n\n00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.881\nI Couldn't believe my luck\n\n00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.041\nwhen she first started showing interest in me.\n\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.321\nI didn't exactly have a lot of experience in talking to women,\n\n00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.261\nand I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.\n\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.060\nSarah. My Sarah was planning to leave me for him.\n\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080\nI couldn't have that. So.\n\n00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.921\nShe was so beautiful, so bright,\n\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.641\nso full of life. I couldn't lose her.\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.761\nI just couldn't lose her. So I killed her.\n\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:27.601\nI didn't have to think about it for long.\n\n00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.201\nIt was the only way she would be mine.\n\n00:07:29.202 --> 00:07:30.281\nOnly mine. Forever.\n\n00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.041\nIf she was dead, she'd never leave me.\n\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:36.281\nShe'd always be my Sarah. And when the police arrived,\n\n00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:37.521\nI made up an elaborate lie\n\n00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.021\nthat she'd gone out to run an errand and never came home.\n\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.220\nThe very same lie ended up on the headlines of national news.\n\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640\nI didn't know if I'd ever even get away with it.\n\n00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.441\nBut a year passed, then another year,\n\n00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.121\nand then another 15 years passed,\n\n00:07:50.122 --> 00:07:52.261\nand no one ever saw through me.\n\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.140\nI was about to walk back upstairs when I heard.\n\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.660\nOh, getting at the window.\n\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.220\nThe sound of a window opening.\n\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420\nAnd that's when I heard it rustling.\n\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.580\nRight there in my house.\n\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.260\nRustling that paralyzed me with fear and sent my mind into a panic.\n\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd then I heard it. Daniel?\n\n00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.501\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's me, Sarah.\n\n00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.001\nThank God I finally got you there.\n\n00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:20.481\nHa ha ha ha ha! Is that what you said?\n\n00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.061\nOh, very good\n"
