But for the longest time (at least 15 years) it was pretty standard: I would feel nothing really after the 2 beers in the week, and on the weekends, 1 day having 10 beers, and the next day recovering: headache, tired, brain fog, general hungover feeling.\n\nAnd i had actually in the last 18 months really started to slow down drinking, no more beers after work and just like 1 day of really drinking on the weekends, I would say at this point in my life, just a normal amount of drinking that people would consider \"normal\".\n\nBut it all changed at the end of June this year: I had one really bad hangover, ears were ringing, crazy anxiety, i couldn't walk in a straight line (not still drunk, but walking coordination was really off) massive anxiety from eye contact (I was at work) couldn't concentrate at all, just riding wave after wave of panic attacks, and walking literally along the wall to stay up straight. I went home early from work at thought \"ok what the hell is going on with me.\" And that was just the beginning.\n\nI would try and drink my normal 2 beers after work, something that never affected me before, and it would literally mean 48 - 72 hours of just massive panic attacks. 2 Beers. No hangover in a normal sense, but really a psyhcological hangover, and in between the panic attacks, just a really weird feeling in general. I was still in denial and would try and drink maybe 5 - 6 beers on my off day, and I even noticed that the drunk feeling was different. The first half of the first beer just made me feel really uneasy (used to make me relax) and when it was over by the 6th beer, i was lightly intoxicated but it just felt different. And the next days would be hell after. We are talking 4 - 5 days of the symptoms I described above, but also more. Eating a normal meal in these days would set off waves of panic attacks, if I felt like drinking a coffee, sometimes it helped, but always in the come down phase, just massive anxiety and attacks. I had numb lips, and the feeling that I would just pass out. Trying to do anything like grocery shopping or going to the bank, just massive attacks, something that never happened before.\n\nI started to look all over the internet like I'm sure we all did, took in tons of information, and eventually found this sub reddit. I read several posts here, and noticed I had a lot of the same symptoms of the people that are also now \"anything more than 3 beers and i have days and days of anxiety/ stopped drinking completely/came on suddenly/any alcohol now is hell\". Well somewhere in the middle of one of these threads, tucked away like 4 comments deep, there was one comment, it had no upvotes: **Take probiotics, you need one like 50,000,000 strong, take several times a day, it made it stop.**\n\nSo I was desperate, I had already tried so many things that I had read on the internet and here, and was getting ready to just lead a life of zero alcohol, but decided to do some research. Most of the chemicals in our brain are produced in the gut, something really like 96%. And anxiety is generally a chemical imbalance, usually involving GABA and Seratonin, or any number of imbalances from dopamine, endorphines, etc. Well, I was going to try it out.\n\nI bought a respected probiotic online, and started to take it twice a day as recommended. I went to the store and bought some activia, and started to eat it once a day. I went to my local asian shop and bought some really high quality kimchee, and I would try and eat a little bit every day. I really just packed my body full of probiotics (but not in an unhealthy way, just wanted several sources as sort of a fail proof) and hoped for the best. **And I want to tell you all, it actually worked.**\n\nI have been doing this now for about 7 weeks, and everything has returned back to normal. I can enjoy my 2 beers like i always had before when I'm in the mood, and sometimes we go out to the beer gardens and really go hard, 8 beers. And I have a normal hangover the next day (tired, headache, sleepy) but not these crazy symptoms that I started to have. My mom came to visit for vacation, and we were drinking like every day maybe 5 beers total every day (10 days) (summer in Germany = a beer at every stop) and now it's the 2nd day she is gone, and I haven't had any alcohol and I feel completely normal.\n\nIf you are like me, and this is something that suddenly started happening to you, and you have tried everything, I would highly suggest you try this, because worse case scenario you just have a really healthy gut bacteria. Best case scenario, it lets you enjoy a normal amount of alcohol again. Now it does take some time. Even a targeted SSRI that would be prescribed for anxiety needs 2 - 4 weeks for a working effect, and that is pharmaceutical grade. This took 7 weeks daily before I saw any difference, but what I am guessing happened is that my gut bacteria was bad, and it was effecting my ability to even out my brain chemicals after drinking/or just in general. Point is, it actually worked and I am normal again.\n\nI will be here to answer any questions if you have them in the comments, but I hope the best to all of you that are just trying to understand what is going on with your body and your mental health.",

I went to the store and bought some activia, and started to eat it once a day. I went to my local asian shop and bought some really high quality kimchee, and I would try and eat a little bit every day. I really just packed my body full of probiotics (but not in an unhealthy way, just wanted several sources as sort of a fail proof) and hoped for the best. &lt;strong&gt;And I want to tell you all, it actually worked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been doing this now for about 7 weeks, and everything has returned back to normal. I can enjoy my 2 beers like i always had before when I&amp;#39;m in the mood, and sometimes we go out to the beer gardens and really go hard, 8 beers. And I have a normal hangover the next day (tired, headache, sleepy) but not these crazy symptoms that I started to have. My mom came to visit for vacation, and we were drinking like every day maybe 5 beers total every day (10 days) (summer in Germany = a beer at every stop) and now it&amp;#39;s the 2nd day she is gone, and I haven&amp;#39;t had any alcohol and I feel completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, and this is something that suddenly started happening to you, and you have tried everything, I would highly suggest you try this, because worse case scenario you just have a really healthy gut bacteria. Best case scenario, it lets you enjoy a normal amount of alcohol again. Now it does take some time. Even a targeted SSRI that would be prescribed for anxiety needs 2 - 4 weeks for a working effect, and that is pharmaceutical grade. This took 7 weeks daily before I saw any difference, but what I am guessing happened is that my gut bacteria was bad, and it was effecting my ability to even out my brain chemicals after drinking/or just in general. Point is, it actually worked and I am normal again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be here to answer any questions if you have them in the comments, but I hope the best to all of you that are just trying to understand what is going on with your body and your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I don’t realize how drunk I am until I look back at it and when I get drunk I yell every sentence and have been told to quiet down from my friends but I can’t help but yell every word and I do other things that embarrass me but when I wake up it feels like the world is ending and I feel like everyone hates me and I feel like I was a bad friend to everyone and I’m scared everyone talks about it behind my back and I feel the need to apologize profusely to everyone and I stopped drinking as much because of this but I did last night and I think I’m going crazy and nothing feels real and I don’t know how to cope with these immense feelings of guilt and regret and anxiety even though I know I didn’t do anything wrong someone please HELP!! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
