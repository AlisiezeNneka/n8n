# 🧠 n8n Automation Workflows by @AlisiezeNneka

This repository is a collection of my custom-built automation workflows designed using [n8n](https://n8n.io), the powerful open-source workflow automation tool. Each workflow is built to automate real business processes with clean logic, smart branching, and reliable integrations.

## 📁 What You’ll Find Here

Inside this repo, you’ll find ready-to-import `.json` files for workflows that cover:

- Lead generation and enrichment
- Email and CRM automation
- Voice AI and call flows
- Social media and content repurposing
- API integrations and custom data handling
- Internal team automation and task scheduling

Each file is named clearly to reflect its purpose, and I keep the logic modular to help you adapt it to your own use case.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open your n8n instance.
3. Click on **Import workflow**.
4. Select the JSON file you want to load.
5. Update any credentials or environment-specific values.
6. Activate the workflow and you’re good to go.
